# Occupational-Licenses
These APIs enable developers to query and retrieve a list of occupational licenses within a state as well as get the details of each license. The data is provided by states to the National Crosswalk Service Center, which then provides the data to CareerOneStop through an agreement worked out between the states and the US DOL.
